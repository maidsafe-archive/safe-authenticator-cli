# SAFE Authenticator CLI
This crate implements a CLI (Command Line Interface) for the [safe_authenticator](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_client_libs/tree/master/safe_authenticator) crate.

The [SAFE Browser](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_browser) provides an integrated Authenticator GUI for users to create SAFE Network accounts, log in using an existing account's credentials (secret and password), authorise applications which need to store data on the network on behalf of the user, see current account's PUT balance, as well as revoke permissions previously granted to applications.

However, there are some scenarios where having to launch the browser just to be able to have the authenticator running is not that practical. E.g., developers working on a desktop SAFE application, either during development, testing, or even debugging phase, may find it uncomfortable or overkilling if all they need it's just the app's credentials to connect to the SAFE Network to test the main logic of such application, and perhaps not the authorisation flow. In these scenarios having a CLI is much more flexible and easy to use as its output could also be chained with other commands, and/or applications can simply execute the CLI and read the result from its `stdout` instead of having to interface with the SAFE Browser/Authenticator through the system URI protocol.

Simply put, this tool provides an alternative to the Authenticator that is currently integrated in the SAFE Browser, and to its communication protocol, allowing to perform the same set of operations but through a command line user interface.

## Build

In order to build this CLI from source code you need to make sure you have `rustc v1.32.0` (or higher) installed. Please take a look at this [notes about Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you need help with installing it. We recommend you install it with `rustup` which will install `cargo` tool since this guide makes use of it.

Once Rust and its toolchain are installed, run the following commands to clone this repository and build the `safe_auth` crate (the build process may take several minutes the first time you run it on this crate):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-cli.git
$ cd safe-authenticator-cli
$ cargo build
```

By default, the `safe_auth` CLI is built with [Mock libraries](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_client_libs/wiki/Mock-vs.-non-mock#mock-libraries), and it still doesn't build for real network. Once that finalised and more tests are performed with the real network, instructions will be added to this guide.

## Run tests

You can run all existing tests with:
```
$ cargo test
```

The `safe_auth` internal functions have some documentation written as [doc tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html). You can run these specific tests with the following command:
```
$ cargo test --doc
```

## Using the CLI

The `safe_auth` can be executed with:
1. `cargo run -- <list of arguments/options>`
2. or directly with the executable generated: `./target/debug/safe_auth <list of arguments/options>`

As any other CLI, the `safe_auth` supports the `--help` argument which outputs a help message with information of the supported arguments and options, you can get this help message with:
```
$ cargo run -- --help
```

The `safe_auth` output can be of two different formats:
1. the default one that can be used by any other applications by parsing the output string obtained from the `stdout`
2. or a nicer output which is intended for human users of the tool that can be enabled with the use of the `--pretty` argument. We are using this argument in all the examples of this guide.

Apart from the output generated in the `stdout`, the `safe_auth` tool also generates logs at different levels like any other Rust application. These logs levels (`debug`, `info`, etc.) can be set by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable, e.g. to set `info` level:
```
$ export RUST_LOG=safe_auth=info
```

Windows users in Command Prompt, will first need to run `set RUST_LOG=safe_auth=info`. If using Windows PowerShell, run `$env:RUST_LOG = "safe_auth=info"`

Note that this environment variable will only persist in your current terminal until it is closed.

Now let's look at some of the features and operations supported, how they can be executed from the CLI, and how they can be combined together.

### Create a SAFE Network account
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --invite-token <token>
Secret:
Password:
Account was created successfully!
```

### Log in the SAFE Network
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty
Secret:
Password:
Logged in the SAFE Network successfully!
```

### Authorising an application
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --req <auth req string>
Secret:
Password:
Authorisation response string: <auth response>
```

As an example, the following command passes a valid encoded authorisation request as the value of the `--req` argument:
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --req bAAAAAAFBMHKYWAAAAAABWAAAAAAAAAAANZSXILTNMFUWI43BMZSS45DFON2C453FMJQXA4BONFSAACYAAAAAAAAAABLWKYSBOBYCAVDFON2A2AAAAAAAAAAAJVQWSZCTMFTGKICMORSC4AACAAAAAAAAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAAL5SG6Y3VNVSW45DTAEAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAAAAOAAAAAAAAAAAL5YHKYTMNFRQCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB
```

The expected encoded authorisation request is the one that can be generated by an application using the SAFE API, e.g. an application using the `safe_app_nodejs` would make use of the [genAuthUri](https://docs.maidsafe.net/safe_app_nodejs/authinterface#genAuthUri), [genConnUri](https://docs.maidsafe.net/safe_app_nodejs/authinterface#genConnUri), [genContainerAuthUri](https://docs.maidsafe.net/safe_app_nodejs/authinterface#genContainerAuthUri), or [genShareMDataUri](https://docs.maidsafe.net/safe_app_nodejs/authinterface#genShareMDataUri) functions to generate such encoded string.

The output obtained from the `safe_auth` CLI command when passing a `--req` argument, can then be used by such a Nodejs application to connect to the SAFE Network with the [loginFromUri](https://docs.maidsafe.net/safe_app_nodejs/authinterface#loginFromUri) function.

### Getting the account's current PUT balance
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --balance
Secret:
Password:
Logged in the SAFE Network successfully!
Account's current balance (PUTs done/available): <done>/<available>
```

### Getting the list of authorised applications
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --apps
Secret:
Password:
Logged in the SAFE Network successfully!
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Authorised Applications         |              |                  |                     |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Id                              | Name         | Vendor           | Permissions         |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| <app ID>                        | <app's name> | <vendor name>    | <app's permissions> |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| ...                                                                                     |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
```

### Getting the account's current PUT balance and list of authorised applications
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --balance --apps
Secret:
Password:
Logged in the SAFE Network successfully!
Account's current balance (PUTs done/available): <done>/<available>
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Authorised Applications         |              |                  |                     |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Id                              | Name         | Vendor           | Permissions         |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| <app ID>                        | <app's name> | <vendor name>    | <app's permissions> |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
| ...                                                                                     |
+---------------------------------+--------------+------------------+---------------------+
```

### Revoking permissions from an application
```
$ cargo run -- --pretty --revoke <app ID>
Secret:
Password:
Logged in the SAFE Network successfully!
Authorised permissions were revoked for app '<app ID>'
```

### Execute Authenticator service, exposing RESTful API
```
$ cargo run -- --daemon 41805
Secret:
Password:
Exposing service on 127.0.0.1:41805
```

Then on a separate terminal you can authorise an application with:
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:41805/authorise/<auth req string>
```
